
It’s not “wrong” to organize modules purely by AWS service—in fact, that’s a common starting point—but as your app grows you’ll often find a domain- or feature-driven layout easier to understand and maintain. Here’s how you might think about it:

1. Service-driven vs. feature-driven

    Service-driven (what you have now):

     ```
     modules/
       ├─ api_gateway/
       ├─ cognito/
       ├─ dynamodb/
       └─ lambda/
     ```

     Each module wraps a single AWS service. This is great for reuse, but it can scatter the pieces of one “feature” across many modules.
    Feature-driven (domain-oriented):

     ```
     modules/
       ├─ user_management/      ← cognito + user‐related lambdas + API Gateway
       ├─ order_processing/     ← DynamoDB + order lambdas + event rules
       └─ notification/         ← SNS/SQS + notification lambdas
     ```

     Each module encapsulates everything needed for one slice of your application.

2. Why feature-driven helps

    Cohesion: All resources for “User” live in one place.
    Discoverability: To onboard someone to “orders,” point them at `modules/order_processing`.
    Simpler versioning: If you make a breaking change to orders, only that module’s version needs bumping.

3. Best-practice layering

    `modules/`
     Small, reusable building blocks (e.g. low-level `network/`, `security_group/`, or your higher-level feature modules).
    `envs/` (or `live/`)
     One folder per environment (dev, staging, prod), each with its own `main.tf`, `backend.tf`, `variables.tf`.
    Remote state & workspaces
     Keep each environment’s state isolated, either via distinct S3 buckets/key prefixes or Terraform Cloud workspaces.

4. Putting it together

   ```
   terraform/
   ├─ modules/
   │   ├─ network/
   │   ├─ security_group/
   │   ├─ feature_user_management/
   │   ├─ feature_order_processing/
   │   └─ feature_notification/
   └─ envs/
       ├─ dev/
       │   ├─ backend.tf
       │   ├─ main.tf          ← calls modules: network, feature_user_management, …
       │   ├─ variables.tf
       │   └─ terraform.tfvars
       ├─ staging/
       └─ prod/
   ```

    `modules/feature_` import service-specific modules under the hood.
    `envs//main.tf` wires your features together into a complete deployment.

5.

    I’ve been thinking about our Terraform layout and I’d like us to try a feature-driven structure: grouping AWS resources by app module (e.g. `user_management`, `order_processing`) rather than by service. That way each team can own a single module that contains everything it needs, which makes the code easier to navigate and version. We’d keep reusable service modules (VPC, SGs, etc.) in `modules/`, and then wire them up per environment under `envs/`.

    Can we sketch out what that might look like for our current work and see if it simplifies our workflows?
   
    Thanks!

Key takeaways:

 You’re not “wrong,” but service-only modules can fragment feature logic.
 A hybrid approach—service modules + feature modules—gives you both reuse and cohesion.
 Organize environments separately to isolate state and configuration.
 Frame the change as a small experiment: see if it streamlines onboarding, versioning, and ownership.
